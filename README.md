#This is the official repository for the Westlake Pi-Rhos 3781

We have kept our code open source to everyone in order to make coding with FTC libraries simpler and easier for people from all teams. Our code is currently being used by not just us, but also other teams, such as the [Westlake Omegas](https://github.com/EtherTyper/ftc_app/commit/64889d6acb25f302fe03727de18fa5dd5c5a3b26) and [Westlake Rhomans](https://github.com/Nianzu/FTCRHOMANS/commits/master). Our hardware has also inspired many other team's robot designs such as the [Westlake Sigmas](https://github.com/Tuschristine). We hope that our knowledge regarding the FTC libraries wont just benefit us, but also other teams who strive to achieve great victory in the competitions.
